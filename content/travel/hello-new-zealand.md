Our flight departed out of O'Hare at 8:30pm on Sunday, 10-13, and we arrived to Auckland at 6:30am on Tuesday, 10-15. We made it through customs without too much trouble, didn't even have our visa checked, but we did have to hand over our tent to the Biosecurity Department - luckily it passed!

So far we've just been working on logistical tasks like setting up bank accounts (as of Oct 1, that was made far more difficult) and are hoping to buy a car this weekend. Looking forward to gettin out on the road!
