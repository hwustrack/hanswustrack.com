Hey there!

I'm Hans. I'm a software developer who deeply enjoys working on an agile team and developing streamlined documented processes to make that team efficient and effective. With my background in tech support, I have also come to love speaking directly with customers and bringing those learnings back to the development team. After working in tech support, I transitioned to a software development position where I built a resilient, high throughput pub sub data pipeline with microservices running in Microsoft Azure.

I'm here from the United States on a Work Holiday Visa, so I'm only able to accept fixed term employment. While I realize this posting is for full time, I thought you might be flexible for the right candidate. With my previous experience in SaaS, effective communication skills, and diligence, I think I could be a great fit.

:-----:|:-----:
Excellent communication skills (code included) to collaborate with a wide range of people|In my final feedback for my previous position, my coworkers said my communication skills is one of my best strengths.
Experience in Ruby On Rails (preferred). Youâ€™ll be pretty good at: Git, ES6, React, html5, scss, BEM, mysql|I do not have experience with Rails but do with ASP.NET, so am familiar with MVC web frameworks. I have professional experience with Git and MS SQL.
Experience building product end to end|In my previous position I was on an API team, so I really only wrote code for that layer, but I do have a couple personal projects, [hanswustrack.com](https://hanswustrack.com/) and [nothinbutscores.com](https://nothinbutscores.com/), which I built myself.
Comfortable working in an lean, agile product development mindset|In my previous position, we used a scrum process to keep the team lean and agile. I took charge in work planning sessions and writing up work items for future work.
Can balance speed and quality|I'm extremely pragmatic in my approach to work, so I'm happy to go deep on a technical issue when needed, or push a simple hotfix to prod when customers are waiting on it.
An inquisitive, proactive and friendly manner|My career has been a bit of a meandering journey from a mechanical engineer in manufacturing to software developer at a tech company. This mostly has to do with my curiosity, optimism, and desire to learn. 
Experience working with clients and customers|With prior experience as a manufacturing engineer and frontline tech support engineer, I have experience working directly with customers in many roles and capacities.
