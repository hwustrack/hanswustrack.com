Hey there!

I'm Hans. I'm a software developer with experience writing C# microservices to run in Microsoft Azure. These services were in support of a high throughput data ingestion API that would reliably route customer's data to a data store. They used a variety of Azure services, including Application Insights, Key Vault, and Azure SQL for a metadata store. We also used Azure DevOps for maintaining and deploying our infrastructure.

I'm here from the United States on a Work Holiday Visa that expires 15 Oct 2020, so I think this contract position would be perfect. With my previous experience in SaaS, effective communication skills, and diligence, I think I could be a great fit.
