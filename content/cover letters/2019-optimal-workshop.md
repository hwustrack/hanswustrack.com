Dear Hiring Manager,

Through launching a couple of side projects and having very little insight into how people are using my websites, I have learned why businesses need Optimal Workshop. I would love to join in your mission of giving businesses the power of customer insight.

I am a highly motivated Software Developer who deeply enjoys working on an agile team and developing streamlined documented processes to make that team efficient and effective. With my background in tech support, I have also come to love speaking directly with customers and bringing those learnings back to the development team. After working in tech support, I transitioned to a software development position where I built a resilient, high throughput pub sub data pipeline with microservices.

As you're probably thinking right now, this experience does not really align with the Data Analyst position I'm applying for. However, the job description, "Are you curious by nature and a good storyteller? Do you love getting to the root of problems, digging through information, discovering solutions and unearthing trends?", really resonated with me and I've always wanted a chance to take a step back and think about deeper business questions rather than just writing code, so I thought this would be a perfect opportunity.

I'm here on the Work Holiday Visa, so I'm able to accept short term work but not long term employment, so I may not be the perfect fit for this role anyway. However, Optimal Workshop looks like a great company that I would be really excited to be a part of. I am confident I could make a positive impact even in a contractual capacity. This role looks really exciting, but if there's a different role that may be better suited for me, I'd be happy to chat about it!
