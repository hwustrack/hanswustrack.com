Hey there!

I'm Hans. I'm a software developer with experience writing C# microservices to run in Microsoft Azure. These services were in support of a high throughput data ingestion API that would reliably route customer's data to a data store. They used a variety of Azure services, including Application Insights, Key Vault, and Azure SQL for a metadata store.

I'm here from the United States on a Work Holiday Visa, so I'm only able to accept fixed term employment. While I realize this posting is for full time, I thought you might be flexible for the right candidate. With my previous experience in SaaS, effective communication skills, and diligence, I think I could be a great fit at DataCraft Analytics.
