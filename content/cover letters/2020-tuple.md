# Where do you live?
I'm currently living in Wellington, New Zealand. In August of last year, I quit my job in the Bay Area and moved to New Zealand on a work holiday visa to travel and work for the year with my girlfriend. We spent the first few months traveling in a camper van (think Christmas lights and kitchen in the trunk) and now we're settled in Wellington for the rest of our stay. We're planning to be here for another few months before moving back to the US.

Here in Wellington, we're 17 hours ahead of you in Boston, and I keep early hours, so I think there should be plenty of overlap (if I start at 5 AM, that would be noon your time).

# What's your background? What are you interested in?
My journey to software has been a bit meandering. I started as a mechanical engineer in aerospace, transitioned to a software company working in tech support, and finally found my way to software development. My last position was easily the happiest of my career and I'm excited to take on a new challenge.

I've spent all of my dev career working in the Microsoft ecosystem - C#, MS SQL, Azure, Visual Studio, the works. On my last team, I worked on a data ingestion API that was built with microservices running in Azure.

I'm interested in building great products for real customers. I love all of the challenges that come with profitably delivering good software - from copywriting to debugging the compiler. That being said, I'm pretty pumped about Rust and Elixir.

# Why are you interested in working with us, specifically?
I first heard of Tuple on the Art of Product and have admired the company since. It's rare for a company to have such a clear value proposition and commitment to the customers in that market segment. With Tuple still being small, I'd also love the chance to move fast and have a really tight feedback loop with customers - both were missing in my last job.

The problem space is also fascinating and I like that Tuple is flexible and realistic about the tools required for a good customer experience e.g. scrapping the Electron app and dropping down to cpp.

# How can we get a sense of your abilities? Can you link us to something or provide code samples?
https://hanswustrack.com/ will give you a sense of my style and writing (and lots of pretty pictures of NZ, who doesn't need more of those?).
- https://hanswustrack.com/posts/how-to-get-beautiful-free-rotating-windows-backgrounds/ is an article I wrote recently.
- https://hanswustrack.com/resume/ is my resume with more detail on previous work experience.

https://github.com/hwustrack is my GitHub account. Some projects I'm proud of that would be a good starting point:
- Nothin But Scores - a service that posts sports scores to Twitter. The service is in the NothinButScoresFunctions repo and the marketing site is NothinButScores.com (https://github.com/hwustrack/NothinButScoresFunctions, https://github.com/hwustrack/NothinButScores.com).
- Product Hunt Analysis - I thought it would be fun to use Product Hunt's free GraphQL API to look for trends in the products submitted in 2019. It's very much a work in progress, but so far it gets a set number of top posts from PH over the last year and caches them to sqlite. I'm now starting to analyze the data retrieved, first looking at the average number of votes each topic gets. I'm planning to write a blog post on anything interesting I find. Code is here - https://github.com/hwustrack/ph-queries.
- I also built a web scraper for a client on Upwork in Python. It tracked metadata for a list of products and compiled a change report. It's in a private repo but I'd be happy to share that if you're interested.

# What are you currently trying to improve about yourself?
- Tech
  - Broaden my experience - coming from my last job, I had a deep knowledge of building backend services in the Microsoft ecosystem but wanted to branch out, both in layers of the stack and technologies. A few projects I've been working on to help with this:
    - Built a few websites to work on my front end skills.
      - https://hanswustrack.com/
      - https://nothinbutscores.com/
      - A proof of concept for my friend's job board project, https://zealous-lamport-07038f.netlify.com/ (https://github.com/hwustrack/EasySourceDemo).
    - Built a web scraper for a client in Python.
    - The next thing on my list is to build something basic in Rust, I've read the starter docs and written the hello world app lots of times but want to build something substantial.
  - Improve my quick estimation skills, quickly coming up with an order of magnitude estimate just seems like a superpower. https://sirupsen.com/napkin/ has been a fun resource for this.
- Personal
  - Expand my personal experience by living in a different country.
  - Get back into the habit of daily exercise. When living in the van, we would hike most days so it didn't need to be so intentional. Now that I'm back living in an apartment, I need to reestablish the exercise habits I had before leaving.
  - Always trying to level up to that next grade in rock climbing.

# Anything else you'd like to tell us? (optional)
After 6 months of traveling in New Zealand, I'm ready to jump into a new challenge. I realize my experience does not overlap much with the technologies Tuple is built on, which may be a concern. Here are the steps I'd take before I started to get up to speed asap (in no particular order):
- Buy a macbook (I said no order, but this seems like a good first)
- Buy books on Swift and C++ programming
- Ask the team what aspect of the product I'll start on, so I can be sure to focus on learning those skills first
- Split time between
  - Going through the reading material on Swift, C++, and Rust programming
  - Building super simple apps in each and working my way up to rebuilding a more complex app like Twitter or SoundCloud

What you can expect working with me:
- I keep early hours, so I'd be happy to start my day pairing with Spencer if he doesn't mind having those sessions in your afternoon
- Clear communication
- Dependability - I love working on a close-knit team
- Pragmatism - I love strategizing on how to deliver value to the customer soonest
- Curiosity - I'll be curious about all aspects of the business, although I'll certainly put all of my energy into the tech to start

I'm really excited to apply and I'd love to talk to you guys more about working together. The video connection should be a bit better clearer in my apartment than I was getting in the camper van.
