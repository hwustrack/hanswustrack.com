# Where do you live?
I'm currently living in Wellington, New Zealand. In August of last year, I quit my job in the Bay Area and moved to New Zealand on a work holiday visa to travel and work for the year **with my girlfriend**. We spent the first few months traveling in a camper van (think christmas lights and not nearly enough space) and now we're settled in Wellington for the rest of our stay. We're planning to be here for another few months before moving back to the US.

# What's your background? What are you interested in?
My journey to software has been a bit meandering. I started as a mechanical engineer in aerospace, moved a software company in tech support, and finally found my way to software development. My last position was easily the happiest of my career and I'm excited to take on a new challenge.

I've spent all of my dev career working in the Microsoft ecosystem - C#, MS SQL, Azure, Visual Studio, the works. On my last team, I worked on a data ingestion API that was built with microservices running in Azure.

My primary interest is in building a great product for real customers. I'm pragmatic and think the tech choice should follow this goal and whatever can serve this need best should be chosen. That being said, I'm pretty pumped about Rust and Elixir.

# Why are you interested in working with us, specifically?
I first heard of Tuple on the Art of Product and have admired the company since. It's rare for a company to have such a clear value proposition and a commitment the customers in that market segment. Tuple still being small, I'd also love the chance to move fast and have a really tight feedback loop with customers, all things that were missing in my last job.

The problem space is also extremely interesting and I like that Tuple sounds flexible and realistic about the tools needed to give a good customer experience e.g. - scrapping the Electron app and dropping down to cpp, using Rust where it makes sense, etc.

# How can we get a sense of your abilities? Can you link us to something or provide code samples?
https://hanswustrack.com/ will give you a good idea of my style and written ability (and lots of pretty pictures of NZ, who doesn't need more of those?).
- https://hanswustrack.com/posts/how-to-get-beautiful-free-rotating-windows-backgrounds/ is an article I wrote recently that'll give you a sense of my communication skills
- https://hanswustrack.com/resume/ is my resume where I share more details about previous work experience

https://github.com/hwustrack is my GitHub account, so this would be a good starting points. Some projects that I'm proud of that would be a good starting point are:
- Nothin But Scores - a service that posts sports scores to Twitter. The service is in the NothinButScoresFunctions (https://github.com/hwustrack/NothinButScoresFunctions) repo and the marketing site is NothinButScores.com (https://github.com/hwustrack/NothinButScores.com).
- I also built a web scraper for a client on Upwork in Python. It's in a private repo but I'd be happy to share that with you if you're interested.

# What are you currently trying to improve about yourself?
- Broaden my tech knowledge - coming from my last job, I had a deep knowledge of building backend services in the Microsoft ecosystem, but wanted to branch out, both in levels of the stack and ecosystems. A few projects I've been working on to help with this:
  - Built a few websites to work on my front end skills - a blog chronicling our NZ journey, hanswustrack.com, and a simple site for my service that posts sports scores to Twitter, NothinButScores.com.
  - Built a web scraper for a client in Python.
  - The next thing on my list is to build something basic in Rust, I've read the first few pages of the docs and written the hello world app lots of times but want to actually build something in it.
- Improve my estimation skills - https://sirupsen.com/napkin/ has been a fun resource for this.
- Expand my personal experience by living in a different country.
- Get back into the habit of daily exercise. When living in the van, we would hike most days so it didn't need to be so intentional. Now that I'm back living in an apartment, I need to reestablish the exercise habits I had before leaving.
- Always trying to level up to that next grade in rock climbing.

# Anything else you'd like to tell us? (optional)
After 6 months of traveling in New Zealand, I'm ready to jump into a new challenge. I realize that I don't have very much experience that overlaps with the technologies Tuple is built on, which may be a concern. Here are the steps I'd take right away to get up to speed as quickly as possible before my start date (in no particular order):
- Buy a macbook (I said no order, but this would be a first)
- Buy books on Swift and C++ programming
- Ask the team where I could be most helpful to start, so I can be sure to focus on learning those skills first
- Split time between
  - Going through the reading material on Swift, C++, and Rust programming
  - Building super simple apps in each and working my way up to rebuilding a complex app like Twitter or SoundCloud

Here's what you can expect working with me:
- Good communication
