Hey there! I'm Hans. I'm a software developer with experience writing C# microservices to run in Microsoft Azure. These services were in support of a high throughput data ingestion API that would reliably route customer's data to a data store. With previous experience as a technical support engineer, I'm also very comfortable working directly with customers on all kinds of issues. 

About 6 months ago I left my job in the United States to move with my girlfriend to New Zealand to travel. In that time I've worked on some personal projects, a blog chronicling our journey, hanswustrack.com, and a service that posts sports scores to Twitter, NothinButScores.com.

We're currently living in Wellington, New Zealand and I would love the chance to work at a remote company doing exciting client work. With my previous experience, effective communication skills, and diligence, I think I could be a great fit.
