Dear Hiring Manager,

I am a highly motivated Software Developer who deeply enjoys working on an agile team and developing streamlined documented processes to make that team efficient and effective. With my background in tech support, I have also come to love speaking directly with customers and bringing those learnings back to the development team. After working in tech support, I transitioned to a software development position where I built highly scalable cloud services using .NET technologies.

I'm currently here from the United States on the Work Holiday Visa, which means I'm able to accept short term employment, but cannot accept anything long term. I'm looking for 6 - 9 month software development contracts, where I can get up to speed quickly and make a significant impact.
