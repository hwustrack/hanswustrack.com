Dear Hiring Manager,

After working with multiple large companies whose priorities did not align with my own in my previous position, the opportunity to work with charity/not-for-profit, environmental, and educational organizations would be a welcome change. With so many tech companies sprouting up, it is their missions that separate them. Xequals' resonates deeply with me. Also, as an aspiring indie hacker, it was exciting to see that Xequals is such a proponent of open source software.

I am a highly motivated Software Developer who deeply enjoys working on an agile team and developing streamlined documented processes to make that team efficient and effective. With my background in tech support, I have also come to love speaking directly with customers and bringing those learnings back to the development team. After working in tech support, I transitioned to a software development position where I built a resilient, high throughput pub sub data pipeline with microservices.

I'm currently here from the United States on the Work Holiday Visa, so the flexibility of this position is really appealing to me. It also seems like it would offer me a bit of time to work on some of the personal goals I have for the year:
- Start contributing to an open source project, hopefully Tailwind CSS, since I find it really useful
- Start learning Rust by writing a simple utility
- Continue growing my small side project, [Nothing But Scores](https://nothinbutscores.com/)

I am eager to speak with you more about the openings for software developers at Xequals and how I can contribute to your continued success.
