Hello.

It's been 5 months since I quit my job in San Francisco and moved to New Zealand with my girlfriend. We came to see the sites, climb mountains, and conduct field research for future Unpslash nature shoots ;)

In my previous role, I worked as a software developer on a data ingestion API that was built with microservices running in Azure. It was a Microsoft shop through and through, so I have lots of experience with Microsoft technologies - C#, .NET Core, MS SQL, Azure, etc. Since hittin' the road, I've worked on a few projects while holed up in the van during rainy stretches - a blog chronicling our journey, hanswustrack.com, and a service that posts sports scores to Twitter, NothinButScores.com. The NothinButScores service is a serverless function that hits a sports API and then posts to Twitter.  The websites for these projects were built with Hugo, a static site generator. I customized the html, css, wrote a few plugins in js, and contributed fixes back to the open-source themes I'm using.

Since leaving my job, I've driven over 5k miles in a camper van, hiked over 100 miles, and eaten too many freeze-dried meals to count. With that out of the way, I'm ready to get back to the working life. I came across Unsplash in a Twitter conversation about great companies. I would love to work in a place that has a positive mission and is realistic about how people work these days. My experience as both a manufacturing engineer and a frontline tech support engineer has shaped my pragmatic problem-solving approach as a software developer.

I'd love to talk more about the type of positions you're hoping to fill at Unsplash as I think I could really fit in well. We have an apartment in Wellington, NZ now, so the Skype connection should be a bit better than I was getting in the van.
