Hello.

I'm writing this from the back of a 2001 converted Toyota minivan, as the sun peaks over the surrounding hills. My girlfriend and I are laying on a 4 x 6 ft platform bed in the back and somehow she manages to sleep despite my elbows knocking into her as I type.

It's been 5 months since I quit my job. In that time I've driven over 5k miles and woken up in a van many mornings. I quit my job in SF last year and moved to New Zealand with my girlfriend to see sites and climb mountains while we still can. There are many things I don't miss about my life in SF, but one thing I do miss is writing software. I've worked on a few projects while holed up in the van during rainy stretches on our trip - a blog chronicling our journey and a service that posts sports scores to Twitter, NothinButScores.com.

I came across Unsplash on Twitter and wanted to apply. I would love to work in a place that has a positive mission and is realistic about how people work these days. I thrive when I'm part of a close-knit team. In that environment, I always try to help out fellow team members and I'll do anything not to let the team down. Starting my career as a manufacturing engineer, moving to frontline tech support has shaped my pragmatic problem solving approach as a software developer. I love diving deep on a complex feature, but am also happy to push a hotfix when customers are waiting. I'd love to talk more about the type of positions you're hoping to fill at Unsplash as I think I could really fit in well.

Welp time to wake my girlfriend up and head off to backpack in Fiordland. See more of my journey at hanswustrack.com or let's have a chat and I can tell you all about it.

Joke about NZ being really pretty and all outdoor pictures being from here?

This makes me think about what I miss about my old job too - working with a close knit team,
