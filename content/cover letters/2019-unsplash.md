Hello.

I'm writing this from the back of a 2001 camper van (well actually just a mini van), scrunched up next to my sleeping girlfriend. I'm laying on a 4 x 6 ft a platform bed in the back and somehow my girlfriend is sleeping as I elbow her in the back while typing. 

It's been 5 months since I quit my job. In that time I've driven over 4k miles and woken up in a van looking out onto the mountains for about half of that. I quit my job in SF last year and moved to New Zealand. I've been driving around in a van with my girlfriend to see sites and climb mountains while we still can. One of the things I miss most is writing software. I've worked on a few projects as we've snaked through the hills, a blog chronicling the journey and a service that posts sports scores to Twitter, NothinButScores.com.

I would love to work in a place that's flexible and doing good in the world. I love working with a close knit team and when put in that environment, I'll do anything not to let the team down. I think my diverse background, starting as a manufacturing engineer, to tech support, finally to development, has instilled a pragmatic problem solving approach to development. Happy to dive deep on a complex feature/bug, but can also push out a hotfix when customers are waiting on it.

Welp I'm headed off to a backpacking trip in Fiordland. Find more about about the journey at hanswustrack.com or let's have a chat and I can tell you all about it.

Appreciate your time,
Hans Wustrack



This makes me think about what I miss about my old job too - working with a close knit team,
