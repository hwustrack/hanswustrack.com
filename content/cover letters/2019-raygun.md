Hi Jeremy,
 
I have been following Raygun ever since I heard about the company in an interview with John-Daniel Trask on a Software Engineering Daily podcast episode. I found the product fascinating. Giving customers high level actionable data, while keeping every bit of raw data collected so customers can dive deeper provides engineers a workflow they can rely on. This is an exciting mission and one I would love to be a part of. With my experience building scalable .NET microservices, I think I would be a great fit.

I am a highly motivated Software Developer who deeply enjoys working on an agile team and developing streamlined documented processes to make that team efficient and effective. With my background in tech support, I have also come to love speaking directly with customers and bringing those learnings back to the development team. After working in tech support, I transitioned to a software development position where I built a resilient, high throughput pub sub data pipeline.

Some technologies used in that product would likely overlap with Raygun’s, for example:

- The product was built with microservices hosted in Microsoft Azure's Service Fabric
- The product was built on .NET Core and a variety of Azure services including Event Hubs, SQL, Table Storage, Application Insights, and Key Vault

In addition to this product experience, I’ve strived to be a leader on my team serving as security champion and as a mentor for new developers.

I'm currently here from the United States on a Work Holiday Visa, allowing me to accept short term work but not long term employment. While my past experience has mostly been with working on backend cloud services, I'd be excited to jump in on any team that may need help. I'm confident that I could onboard quickly and make a significant impact to my team and the product in that capacity.

While I've never used Raygun's products on one of my apps, they look incredibly useful for developers and it would be really exciting to get a chance to help the team continue to improve and expand them. I’m eager to talk to you more about any open positions as Raygun and how I may be able to contribute to Raygun’s continued success.
