Dear Hiring Manager,

There is a certain magic in selling something you no longer need to someone who is extremely excited to buy it. During my last cross country move in the United States, I had to sell all of my furniture. Listing each piece on Craigslist and seeing them continue to get use, rather than going straight to the dump, was incredibly encouraging. I would love to be a part of making that possible at Trade Me.

I am a highly motivated Software Developer who deeply enjoys working on an agile team and developing streamlined documented processes to make that team efficient and effective. With my background in tech support, I have also come to love speaking directly with customers and bringing those learnings back to the development team. After working in tech support, I transitioned to a software development position where I built a resilient, high throughput pub sub data pipeline with microservices.

I am confident that with this experience, I can become an important part of the team and help Trade Me continue to expand the biggest e-commerce platform in New Zealand.

I am eager to speak with you more about the openings for Intermediate Cloud Systems Engineer developers at Trade Me and how I can contribute to your continued success.
