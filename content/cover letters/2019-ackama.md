Dear Hiring Manager,

After working with multiple large companies whose priorities did not align with my own in my previous position, the opportunity to work for a company who is values driven would be a welcome change. With so many tech companies sprouting up, it is their missions that separate them. Ackama's core values of inclusion and continual personal growth resonates deeply with me. I think I would make a great addition to the Ackama team.

I am a highly motivated Software Developer who deeply enjoys working on an agile team and developing streamlined documented processes to make that team efficient and effective. With my background in tech support, I have also come to love speaking directly with customers and bringing those learnings back to the development team. After working in tech support, I transitioned to a software development position where I built a resilient, high throughput pub sub data pipeline with microservices.

At Ackama, I would be extremely excited to take on roles outside of my direct development responsibilities, like working directly with customers on requirements and attending sales pitches. The chances to learn new some languages and frameworks, like Elixir and Phoenix, along the way would be a welcome opportunity as well.

I am eager to speak with you more about the openings for Intermediate Developers at Ackama and how I can contribute to your continued success.
