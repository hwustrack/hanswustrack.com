Hey there!

I'm Hans. I'm a software developer with experience writing C# microservices to run in Microsoft Azure. These services were in support of a high throughput data ingestion API that would reliably route customer's data to a data store. With previous experience as a technical support engineer, I'm also very comfortable working directly with customers on all kinds of issues. 

About 6 months ago I left my job in the United States to move to New Zealand with my girlfriend to travel and work. In that time I've worked on some personal projects, a blog chronicling our journey, [hanswustrack.com](https://hanswustrack.com), and a service that posts sports scores to Twitter, [NothinButScores.com](https://nothinbutscores.com).

After spending a few months on the road in a van, we've settled down in Wellington, New Zealand. I applied to an opening at Xero in the Wellington office, but after a few conversations, they couldn't accommodate the terms of my visa. When I move back to the US, I'd love the chance to work at a company that I've really come to admire while living in New Zealand.

With my previous experience, effective communication skills, and diligence, I think I would be a great fit.
