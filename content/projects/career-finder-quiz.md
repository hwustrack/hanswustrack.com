When it became clear COVID-19 really was going to have a massive impact, my friend and I started a job board to help those finding themselves out of work, [CareerQuizFinder.com](https://careerfinderquiz.com/). My friend is in business school, so he focused on finding companies we could pull jobs from and soliciting feedback from users, while I worked on building the site. It's built on a jamstack - Vue.js front end, Hugo SSG, AWS Lambda API, and a MySQL db. 

Our goal was to give job seekers better tools to browse jobs without requiring them to sign up or pay for any sort of service. We both agree we've achieved that goal and have now been exploring adding some advanced search features.
