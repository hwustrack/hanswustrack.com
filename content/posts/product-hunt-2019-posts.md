ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ In Progress ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Product Hunt (PH) has a really awesome free [GraphQL API](https://api.producthunt.com/v2/docs) that I wanted to try out, so I figured I'd pull some posts and see what I could find.

I retrieved the top 1944 posts by vote count, submitted between 2019-01-01T12:00:00Z and 2020-03-01T12:00:00Z. The data was pulled on 3-12-2020. The goal was simply to get a lot of posts over the last year and take a look at some of the trends.

## Background

A bit about the terminology here (which is detailed in the [PH API docs](https://api.producthunt.com/v2/docs)). I'm mainly focused on Posts, which is the thing you scroll through on the [home page](https://www.producthunt.com/) of Product Hunt. Posts have assorted fields like name, creation time, description, vote count, etc. I also looked at the Topics. Each Post has a series of Topics associated with it, which is like a tag to categorize the Post.

## Top Posts

{{< ph-top >}}

[INK](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ink-1c962f43-e6e2-4291-942f-6090712bf2b6) was the clear outlier here.

## Vote counts by hour submitted

I binned the posts hour submitted to see if we see any advantages to posting at a certain time of day.

70% of the posts were submitted between 6 - 8 UTC (2 - 4 EST), which was a bit surprising to me, but could mean a lot of people using PH are posting from Europe.

## Topics

### Most Common

{{< ph-topics-count >}}

Productivity and Tech clearly far exceed the others. 74% of the posts had at least one of these topics associated with it.

### Performance

The next two charts look at the average number of votes a particular topic received. Only topics that had at least 10 posts associated with it were included here.

The first chart sort is sorted by votes mean.

This second chart is sorted by votes standard deviation.
