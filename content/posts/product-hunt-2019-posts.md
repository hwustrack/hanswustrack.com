ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ In Progress ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

Product Hunt has a really awesome free [GraphQL API](https://api.producthunt.com/v2/docs) that I wanted to try out, so I figured I'd pull some posts and see what I could find.

I retrieved the top 1944 posts by vote count, submitted between 2019-01-01T12:00:00Z and 2020-03-01T12:00:00Z. The data was pulled on 3-12-2020. Arbitrary? Absolutely. But my goal was simply to get a lot of posts over the last year and take a look at some of the trends.

## Background

A bit about the terminology here (which is all laid out in the [PH docs](https://api.producthunt.com/v2/docs)). I'm mainly focusing here on Posts, which is the thing you scroll through on the main page. Posts have a series of fields like name, creation time, description, vote count, etc. I also look at the Topics. A Post has a series of Topics associated with it.

## Top Posts

{{< ph-top >}}

[INK](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/ink-1c962f43-e6e2-4291-942f-6090712bf2b6) was the clear outlier here.

## Vote counts by hour submitted

I binned the posts hour submitted to see if we see any advantages to posting at a certain time of day.

{{< ph-hourly-trend >}}

70% of the posts were submitted between 6 - 8 UTC (2 - 4 EST).

## Topics

### Most Common

Topics submitted most often.

{{< ph-topics-count >}}

Productivity and Tech clearly far exceed the others. 74% of the posts had at least one of these topics associated with it.

### Performance

The next two charts look at the average number of votes a particular topic received. Only topics that had at least 10 posts submitted with them were included.

The first chart sort is sorted by votes mean.

This second chart is sorted by standard deviation.

## Conclusion
