# Get sign ups

Netlify Form (only 100/month for free) -> Zapier -> Google Sheet

# Notify on new post

I manually add people from the Google Sheet to my Google Contacts and add a label, then send a group email to the label.

# Allow you to unsubscribe

Anyone receiving the emails will need to respond to me and I'll remove them from the list.
