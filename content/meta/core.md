# Framework

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [Minimo](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimo/) theme. I looked at Jekyll and Gatsby too but ultimately went with Hugo as it looked like the best balance of simplicity and flexibility. Plus it's built on Golang, so it's extremely fast.

# Hosting

This site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). I cannot recommend them enough. They offer free hosting for basic websites like mine, and offer automatic deployments from a github repo.

All images are hosted on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). You get tons of storage and bandwidth for free, without even having to put in a credit card! Their API is also extremely flexible, allowing you to add simple parameters to the url to reduce image file sizes on demand.

# Domain

I bought the domain on Google Domains. I liked that they had simple pricing, with no upsells.
