I'm a software developer who has primarily worked on distributed services running in the cloud. It took me a while to get there, and may take some time to get back.

In 2014, I received a BS in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Wisconsin. Soon after, I moved out to Tacoma, WA, my first time living outside of WI.  The job was in aerospace manufacturing, but it was really just an excuse to move to the west coast. I had a great manager, but manufacturing was not a great personal fit.

I jumped at the chance to move to a software company in the Bay Area, starting in tech support. I moved from tech support, to IT development, and finally to the engineering department as a software developer. I loved CA and really enjoyed my time at OSIsoft, with many coworkers becoming good friends and the work being continually challenging and interesting.

With the itch to travel and the Bay Area becoming exhausting, in August 2019, I left my job and moved to New Zealand with my girlfriend to travel and work. We're planning to be here for a year, returning to somewhere in the US in the fall of 2020.
